# Budget App
The Budget Allocation App is a React-based tool designed for managing and allocating budgets across various departments. Users can set an initial budget and adjust department allocations dynamically. The app uses context-based state management to keep budget changes consistent across components. It features alerts to prevent allocations from exceeding the total budget or going below allocated amounts. The app also supports multiple currencies, allowing users to switch between them and see the appropriate currency symbols, making it a versatile and user-friendly budget management tool.
